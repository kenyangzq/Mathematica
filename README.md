The Main_by_Ken is the routine for generating Voronoi Diagram and Animation for 3d sphere configuration.\n
Compare* are files used to compare algorithms and also different input value. 
4d* are for visualization of 4d Voronoi cell using input file in inputfile folder.
Caspar-Klug* use lattice to generate nice configurations on 3d sphere.
Ed's Conjecture is a pratice one to verify the conjecture in Edward Saff's paper.
